# Employee Directory App

A simple frontend application to manage an employee directory using HTML, CSS, JS, and Freemarker templates.

## Features

- Add, edit, delete employee records
- Client-side filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Responsive UI for desktop and mobile
- No backend: all data handled in JavaScript memory

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `index.ftlh` in a Freemarker-compatible server or use as `.html` for static demo
3. All scripts are in `/static/js/` and styles in `/static/css/`

## Structure

- `data.js`: Mock employee data
- `app.js`: All client-side logic
- `style.css`: Styling and responsive layout
- `index.ftlh`: Template rendering (can be renamed to `.html` for demo)

## Future Improvements

- Store data in browser localStorage
- Add department and role dropdowns
- Improve accessibility and animations
